## Airline Delay Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of airline delays using machine learning models. The goal is to predict flight delays based on various features, enabling better planning and decision-making for airlines and passengers.

## Introduction
Flight delays are a significant concern for airlines and passengers alike, leading to financial losses and inconvenience. This project analyzes historical flight data to develop predictive models that can estimate the likelihood of delays.

## The analysis includes:
1. Data preprocessing and visualization to understand delay patterns.
2.Implementation of multiple regression models to predict delays.
3. Building a predictive system to forecast delays in real-time.
