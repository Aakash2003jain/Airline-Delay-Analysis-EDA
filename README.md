# Airline-Delay-Analysis-EDA
The aviation industry plays a crucial role in connecting people and businesses worldwide, facilitating seamless travel experiences and promoting economic growth. However, flight delays continue to pose significant challenges for airlines, passengers, and airport operations. To address this issue, we aim to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive dataset collected in the year 2019, focusing on flight delays and their underlying factors.

The dataset encompasses a diverse set of features, including 'OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER', 'ORIGIN', 'DEST', 'DEP_TIME', 'DEP_DELAY', 'ARR_TIME', 'ARR_DELAY', 'DISTANCE', and 'FL_DATE'. The primary objective of this project is to understand the relationships between various factors and the 'ARR_DELAY', which represents the delay in a flight's arrival time.

Through EDA, we seek to uncover valuable insights and correlations within the data to identify key drivers of flight delays. By analyzing factors such as departure delays, distances, and flight routes, we aim to determine their impact on arrival delays. Additionally, we will utilize predictive modeling techniques to forecast 'ARR_DELAY' based on relevant features.
The findings of this analysis will offer actionable recommendations to airlines and airports for optimizing flight operations and reducing delays. By understanding the factors influencing flight delays, airlines can implement efficient scheduling strategies, manage departure delays effectively, and optimize long-haul routes. This, in turn, can lead to improved on-time performance, reduced costs, enhanced passenger satisfaction, and a more reliable travel experience.

As we explore the dataset and derive insights through EDA, we will highlight the significance of data-driven decision-making in the aviation industry. Our project aims to contribute valuable knowledge and solutions to address the complex challenge of flight delays, ultimately benefiting both stakeholders and passengers in the dynamic world of air travel.
